**Used to create a binary counter via a KIM1 board, LED's, and a ULN2803A transistor array for not gates to create a ground**

LDA #$FF    \\Load to 0200
STA $1701   \\Move to CPU from memory
LDA #$00   \\Load 
STA $1700  \\store
INC $1700  \\increment by one 
JMP $0200  \\ jump back to original adress
