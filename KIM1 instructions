**Used to create a binary counter via a KIM1 board, LED's, and a ULN2803A transistor array for not gates to create a ground**

LDA #$FF    \\Load to 0200   A9 FF
STA $1701   \\Move to CPU from memory  8D 01 17
LDA #$00   \\Load A9 00
STA $1700  \\store  8D 00 17
INC $1700  \\increment by one  EE 00 17
JMP $0200  \\ jump back to original address  4C 0A 02

The above Mnemonic Instructions begin at AD $0200
